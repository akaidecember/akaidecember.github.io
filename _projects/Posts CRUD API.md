description: For this mini-project, I have used the fastAPI library to create endpoints. PostgreSQL is used for database creation and storage of data. I have tried using two methods of accessing the db. First, via SQL statements, for which I have used pydantic library. I also tried the no-SQL query approach using an ORM (SQLAlchemy) in this case. The code is currently updated to use SQLAlchemy.
