description: This project is a parser for Baby-C, a subset of the C programming language, developed using Bison, Flex, and C. The parser is designed to analyze Baby-C source code, ensuring it adheres to the syntax and grammar rules defined for Baby-C. The code is then translated to ILOC for CPU execution. This project aims to provide a foundational tool for understanding and experimenting with language parsing concepts.
