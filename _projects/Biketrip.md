description: In this project, we analyze the SF Bay Area Bike Share dataset. The dataset has information on bikes, stations, weather, and bike trips. The goal is to use ML techniques to better understand the dataset. We use techniques like clustering, regression, visualization, and dimensionality to predict trips for a condition.
