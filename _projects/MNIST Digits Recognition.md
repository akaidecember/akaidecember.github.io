description: This project is about recognizing digits in an image using OpenCV and a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The program reads the video feed from the default camera or a video file and recognizes digits in each frame. The recognized digits are marked with a bounding box and the recognized digit is labeled.
