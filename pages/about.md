# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>. I'm a Software Engineer with experience designing and operating distributed systems, event-driven microservices, and AI-augmented backend pipelines. Proficient in Python, Java, Node.js, and TypeScript, with strong focus on reliability, performance optimization, data workflows, and cloud-native infrastructure. I build systems that scale and fail gracefully.
